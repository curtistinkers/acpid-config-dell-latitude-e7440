# Config files for Dell Latitude E7440

I use a Dell Latitude E7440 laptop for a low-power Proxmox home server with the bonus that it has a built-in battery backup.

This set of files is meant to simplify administration and make configuration repeatable.

## Output of `acpi_listen`

For a complete list of outputs for the buttons, function keys, and lid actions, see the [acpid-output.md](acpid-output.md) file.
